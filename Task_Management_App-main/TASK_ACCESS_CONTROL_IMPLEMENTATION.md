# Task Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented proper access control for task management where only task creators can edit tasks, while assignees can only view and interact with limited functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates

#### TaskPolicy.php
- Updated `view()` method to support many-to-many relationships
- Now allows creator, assigned_user, and users in assignedUsers relationship to view tasks
- Maintains security by only allowing task creators to edit/delete

### 2. Frontend Component Updates

#### TaskItem.js
- Added `getCurrentUser()` helper function
- **Edit & Delete Buttons**: Only visible to task creators (`getCurrentUser()?.id === task.user_id`)
- **Priority Selector**: 
  - Creators: Interactive dropdown to change priority
  - Assignees: Read-only display showing current priority
- **Status Controls**: 
  - Creators: Interactive dropdown to change status
  - Assignees: Read-only display showing current status
- **Attachments**: 
  - Creators: Can upload, view, download, and delete attachments (`canEdit={true}`)
  - Assignees: Can only view and download attachments (`canEdit={false}`)

#### TaskManager.js  
- Added `getCurrentUser()` helper function
- **Manage Assignments Button**: Only visible to task creators
- Restricts assignment management to task creators only

#### EditTask.js
- Updated to use same permission logic for attachments
- Only task creators can access edit functionality

#### AttachmentsList.js
- Enhanced UI to show "View & Download Only" indicator for assignees
- Different messaging for assignees vs creators when no attachments exist
- Upload functionality hidden from assignees

### 3. CSS Updates

#### TaskItem.css
- Added styles for `priority-display` and `status-display` classes
- Consistent styling for read-only elements
- Better visual distinction between interactive and display-only elements

#### AttachmentsList.css
- Added styles for `view-only-indicator`
- Added styles for `no-attachments-message`

## User Experience

### For Task Creators (user_id === task.user_id):
✅ Can view all task details  
✅ Can edit task title, description, due date  
✅ Can change task status and priority  
✅ Can delete tasks  
✅ Can manage task assignments  
✅ Can upload, view, download, and delete attachments  
✅ Can postpone tasks  

### For Assigned Users (assigned_user_id or in assignedUsers):
✅ Can view all task details  
✅ Can view attachments uploaded by creator  
✅ Can download attachments  
✅ Can postpone tasks  
❌ Cannot edit task details  
❌ Cannot change task status or priority  
❌ Cannot delete tasks  
❌ Cannot manage task assignments  
❌ Cannot upload or delete attachments  

## Security Features

1. **Frontend Protection**: UI elements hidden based on user permissions
2. **Backend Protection**: API endpoints validate user permissions via TaskPolicy
3. **File Access Control**: Only task participants can access attachments
4. **Role-based UI**: Different interfaces for creators vs assignees

## Visual Indicators

- **Priority & Status**: Interactive dropdowns for creators, read-only badges for assignees
- **Attachments**: "View & Download Only" indicator for assignees
- **Buttons**: Edit, Delete, and Assignment management buttons only shown to creators
- **Consistent Styling**: All read-only elements have distinct visual styling

This implementation ensures that assignees can collaborate on tasks by viewing content and downloading files, while maintaining data integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications.
