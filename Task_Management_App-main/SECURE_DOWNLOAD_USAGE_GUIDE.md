# Laravel Policies for Secure Downloads - Implementation Summary

## 🔐 What Was Implemented

### 1. **TaskAttachmentPolicy** - Fine-grained Authorization
- **File**: `app/Policies/TaskAttachmentPolicy.php`
- **Features**:
  - `download()` - Controls who can download attachments
  - `view()` - Controls who can see attachment metadata
  - `create()` - Controls who can upload attachments
  - `delete()` - Controls who can delete attachments
  - `update()` - Controls who can modify attachment metadata

### 2. **SecureDownloadMiddleware** - Rate Limiting & Security Monitoring
- **File**: `app/Http/Middleware/SecureDownloadMiddleware.php`
- **Features**:
  - Rate limiting (50 downloads/user/minute, 100/IP/minute)
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Bot detection via User-Agent analysis
  - Rapid download pattern detection
  - Comprehensive security logging

### 3. **Updated Controllers** - Policy Integration
- **Files**: 
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TaskApiController.php`
  - `app/Http/Controllers/TaskController.php`
- **Changes**:
  - All attachment methods now use `$this->authorize()`
  - Proper exception handling for authorization failures
  - Enhanced security logging for audit trails

### 4. **Route Protection** - Middleware Application
- **Files**: 
  - `routes/api.php`
  - `routes/web.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Download routes protected with `secure.download` middleware
  - Maintains existing functionality while adding security

## 🔑 Authorization Rules

### Who Can Download Files?
Users can download attachments if they are:
1. **Task Creator** - The user who created the task
2. **Assigned User** - User assigned to the task (`assigned_user_id`)
3. **Team Member** - User in the many-to-many relationship with the task

### Who Can Delete/Modify Files?
Users can delete/modify attachments if they are:
1. **Task Creator** - Full control over all task attachments
2. **File Uploader** - Can manage their own uploaded files

## 📊 Security Features

### Rate Limiting
```
✅ 50 downloads per user per minute
✅ 100 downloads per IP per minute
✅ Automatic cache-based tracking
✅ Graceful error responses (HTTP 429)
```

### Monitoring & Logging
```
✅ All download attempts logged
✅ Suspicious activity detection
✅ Rate limit violations tracked
✅ Bot detection and alerting
✅ User behavior analytics
```

### Authorization
```
✅ Laravel Policy-based access control
✅ Multi-level permission checking
✅ Task-based file access restrictions
✅ User role verification
```

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test suite was created (`tests/Feature/SecureDownloadTest.php`) covering:
- ✅ Authorized user downloads
- ✅ Unauthorized access prevention
- ✅ API endpoint security
- ✅ File deletion permissions
- ✅ Policy enforcement

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### API Download (Authorized)
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
     "https://your-app.com/api/v1/tasks/1/attachments/5/download"
```

### Web Download (Logged in user)
```html
<a href="{{ route('tasks.attachments.download', [$task, $attachment]) }}">
    Download {{ $attachment->original_name }}
</a>
```

### Check if User Can Download (In Blade)
```php
@can('download', $attachment)
    <a href="{{ route('tasks.attachments.download', [$task, $attachment]) }}">
        Download File
    </a>
@endcan
```

### Check in Controller
```php
if (auth()->user()->can('download', $attachment)) {
    // User is authorized to download
}
```

## 📈 Monitoring Dashboard Queries

### Recent Downloads
```php
// Get recent downloads from logs
Log::info('Attachment downloaded', [
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'task_id' => $task->id,
    'attachment_id' => $attachment->id,
    'file_name' => $attachment->original_name
]);
```

### Security Alerts
```php
// Rate limit violations
Log::warning('Download rate limit exceeded', [
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'downloads' => $count
]);

// Suspicious activity
Log::warning('Suspicious download attempt detected', [
    'user_agent' => $userAgent,
    'pattern' => $detected_pattern
]);
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Rate Limits
Edit `SecureDownloadMiddleware.php`:
```php
$userLimit = 50;  // Downloads per user per minute
$ipLimit = 100;   // Downloads per IP per minute
```

### Customize Suspicious Activity Detection
Edit the `checkSuspiciousActivity()` method to add new patterns or adjust thresholds.
