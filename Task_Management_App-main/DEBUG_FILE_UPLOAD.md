# File Upload Permission Fix

## Issue
Assignees cannot upload files to tasks due to permission restrictions.

## Debug Steps

1. **Check Authentication**: Verify if user is properly authenticated
2. **Check Task Access**: Ensure assignee has access to task
3. **Check CORS**: Verify CORS settings allow file uploads
4. **Check File Validation**: Ensure file meets validation requirements

## Temporary Fix Applied

Added detailed logging to identify the exact permission issue.

## Next Steps

1. Test with a different user account
2. Check browser network tab for exact error response
3. Verify database relationships are working correctly
