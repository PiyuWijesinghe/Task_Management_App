# FILE DELETION TEST RESULTS

## Test Overview
Testing file deletion functionality in the Task Management App to verify:
1. Files are properly deleted from the database
2. Files are properly deleted from the file system  
3. Both API and UI deletion work correctly

## Current System State (Before Testing)

### Database Status
- **3 attachments** found in database:
  - ID 1: Screenshot 2025-10-15 203205.png (task-attachments/2bb98b6a-dc8d-4450-810d-97342629430c.png)
  - ID 2: images (1).jpg (task-attachments/9798338e-10da-411e-a1ab-9d82c772236b.jpg) 
  - ID 3: CSA_Experiences_ocean_lens.jpg (task-attachments/9355435c-7bfb-46ad-adff-098b802f5752.jpg)

### File System Status  
- **19 files** in `storage/app/private/task-attachments/`
- **5 files** in `storage/app/task-attachments/`
- Some orphaned files exist (files without database records)

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: UI Testing (Recommended)
1. Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/test_deletion.html
2. Login with: `john@example.com` / `password123`
3. Create a new task
4. Upload a test file
5. Note the attachment ID and filename
6. Click "Delete" button on the attachment
7. Verify the file disappears from the UI
8. Run verification check

### Option 2: API Testing  
Use the provided test scripts:
- `test_file_deletion.bat` - Windows batch script for API testing
- `test_file_deletion.php` - PHP script for comprehensive testing
- `verify_file_system.php` - File system verification

### Option 3: Manual API Testing
```bash
# 1. Login
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# 2. Get tasks with attachments  
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 3. Delete specific attachment
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tasks/{TASK_ID}/attachments/{ATTACHMENT_ID} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Verification Steps

### After Each Deletion Test:
1. **Check Database**: Run `php artisan check:attachments` 
2. **Check File System**: Verify physical file is removed from storage directory
3. **Check UI**: Ensure attachment no longer appears in attachments list
4. **Check API**: GET request to attachments endpoint should not include deleted file

### Expected Results:
✅ **PASS**: File removed from both database AND file system  
❌ **FAIL**: File remains in database OR file system after deletion

## Available Test Files for Deletion
Current attachments that can be safely deleted for testing:

| ID | Filename | Path | Task |
|----|----------|------|------|
| 1 | Screenshot 2025-10-15 203205.png | 2bb98b6a-dc8d-4450-810d-97342629430c.png | Task 1 |
| 2 | images (1).jpg | 9798338e-10da-411e-a1ab-9d82c772236b.jpg | Task 2 | 
| 3 | CSA_Experiences_ocean_lens.jpg | 9355435c-7bfb-46ad-adff-098b802f5752.jpg | Task 2 |

## Test Commands
```powershell
# Check current state
cd task-app
php artisan check:attachments

# After deletion, verify again  
php artisan check:attachments

# Check file system directly
Get-ChildItem storage\app\task-attachments
Get-ChildItem storage\app\private\task-attachments
```

## Notes
- Laravel server must be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Database uses SQLite (database/database.sqlite)
- Files stored in both `storage/app/task-attachments` and `storage/app/private/task-attachments`
- Deletion policy enforced - only file uploader or task owner can delete attachments
