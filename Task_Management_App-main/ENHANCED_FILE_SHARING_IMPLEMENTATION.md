# Enhanced Task File Sharing Implementation

## නව Features

### 🎯 **Key Requirements Implemented:**
- ✅ **Assignees can upload files** - අසයින් වූ අයට files upload කරන්න පුළුවන්
- ✅ **All files visible to everyone** - creator සහ assignees ලාට සියලුම files බලන්න පුළුවන්
- ✅ **Uploader identification** - කවුද upload කරේ කියන එක පේනවා
- ✅ **Smart delete permissions** - creator ට ඕනම file එකක් delete කරන්න පුළුවන්, assignees ලාට තමන්ගේ files විතරක් delete කරන්න පුළුවන්

## 📋 **Updated User Permissions**

### **Task Creator** (task.user_id):
- ✅ Can view all files (creator & assignee uploaded)
- ✅ Can upload new files
- ✅ Can download all files
- ✅ **Can delete ANY file** (full control)

### **Assignees** (assigned users):
- ✅ Can view all files (creator & assignee uploaded)
- ✅ **Can upload new files** 
- ✅ Can download all files
- ✅ **Can delete ONLY their own uploaded files**

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Changes**
1. **New Migration**: `add_uploaded_by_to_task_attachments_table`
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE task_attachments ADD COLUMN uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id)
   ```

### **Backend Updates**

#### **TaskAttachment Model**
- Added `uploaded_by` to fillable fields
- Added `uploadedBy()` relationship method
- Tracks who uploaded each file

#### **Controllers Updated**
- **TaskController & TaskApiController**
  - `storeAttachment()`: Now saves `uploaded_by = auth()->id()`
  - `getAttachments()`: Loads uploader info with `->with('uploadedBy')`
  - `deleteAttachment()`: Smart permission check (creator OR uploader can delete)

### **Frontend Updates**

#### **AttachmentsList Component**
- **New Props**: Added `canUpload` separate from `canEdit`
- **Upload Access**: All assigned users can now upload files
- **Uploader Display**: Shows "👤 By: [Username]" for each file
- **Smart Delete**: Delete button only shows if user can delete that specific file

#### **Permission Logic**
```javascript
// Upload: Everyone with task access can upload
canUpload={true}

// Delete: Creator can delete any file, others can delete only their files
canDelete = {canEdit || getCurrentUser()?.id === attachment.uploaded_by?.id}

// Edit other fields: Only creator can edit task details
canEdit = {getCurrentUser()?.id === task.user_id}
```

## 🎨 **UI Enhancements**

### **File Display**
Each attachment now shows:
- 📎 File name and icon
- 📊 File size
- 🕒 Upload timestamp  
- 👤 **Uploader name** (NEW)
- ⬇️ Download button (everyone)
- 🗑️ Delete button (creator or uploader only)

### **Visual Indicators**
- **Uploader Badge**: Small rounded badge showing who uploaded
- **Smart Buttons**: Delete button appears contextually
- **Consistent Styling**: New uploader info integrates seamlessly

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **Backend Authorization**
1. **Upload**: Must have task access (creator, assigned_user, or in assignedUsers)
2. **View/Download**: Must have task access  
3. **Delete**: Must be creator OR be the uploader of that specific file

### **Frontend Protection**
1. **UI Controls**: Buttons only show when user has permission
2. **User Identification**: Uses localStorage user data for client-side checks
3. **Fallback Security**: Backend validates all requests regardless of UI

## 📝 **Example Usage Flow**

1. **Creator creates task** with initial files
2. **Creator assigns task** to multiple users
3. **Assignee A uploads** additional files (documents, images)
4. **Assignee B uploads** their files
5. **Everyone can see all files** from creator, Assignee A, and Assignee B
6. **Creator can delete any file**
7. **Assignee A can only delete their own files**
8. **Assignee B can only delete their own files**

## 🚀 **Benefits**

- **Collaborative**: All team members can contribute files
- **Organized**: Clear visibility of who contributed what
- **Secure**: Appropriate permissions prevent unauthorized deletion
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with clear visual indicators
- **Scalable**: Supports multiple assignees contributing files

This implementation perfectly matches the requirements: "assignees can upload files, all files visible to everyone, both creator and assignees can see who uploaded what."
